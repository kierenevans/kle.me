        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>I'm a senior software engineer and DevOps practitioner
           with a Computer Science degree who is passionate about 
           enabling developers to move faster through the use of DevOps 
           tooling and conversations.</p>

        <p>I give the devs the tools to own their deployment pipeline and
           help them be confident in managing production through
           observability.</p>

         <p>I absolutely love when my advice or code improvement
            solves a problem, has a positive impact on a team or
            lets them move faster towards their and their 
            customer's goals.</p>
